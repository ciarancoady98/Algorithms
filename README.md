# Algorithms
This repository contains implementations of various different algorithms and data structures implemented in java.

Each lab(assignment) was designed to challenge us to develop code to implement various algorithms and data structures, along with junit tests to ensure that we understood the theory behind each one.

In these Assignments we also explored the implications of the algorithms developed. Analysis of the time and space complexity of each algorithm using BigOh notation has been added as comments to the code. 

Algorithms Lab 1 : Counts for the number of non-horizontal lines that go through 3 points in arrays a1, a2, a3. This is achieved using a brute force approach and also using a binary search approach. 

Algorithms Lab 2 : Is an implementation of a doubly linked list and some useful functions that manipulate it.

Algorithms Lab 3 : Is an implementation of a binary search tree.

Algorithms 2 Lab 1 : Is a implementation and comparison of various different sorting algorithms.

Algorithms 2 Lab 2 : Is a shortest path problem. Dijkstra and Floyd-Warshall shortest path algorithms have been implemented and compared.
